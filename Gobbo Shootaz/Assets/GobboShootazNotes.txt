TODO:
- Create a bigger & better blockout of the level and add more enemies.

ISSUES:
- Bumping your head triggers the isGrounded boolean; Results in you sticking to the ceiling and then "resuming" the jump after contact is broken with the ceiling's surface.

NOTABLE CHANGES:
- (07/09/24) Added else statement in the OnLook method in StarterAssetsInput.cs to prevent camera from moving during game over state.
- (07/17/24) Added a rigidbody to the ammo crate pickup (with freezed position & rotation) to enable collisions between the characterController(Player) and the ammo crate's collider.
