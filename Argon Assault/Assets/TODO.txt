== TODO Section ==
- Modify Enemy Path (Add moments where it can collide with the player)
- Add Obstacles (Add only a little for the moment, for testing)(Want to test something for this: a collapsing bridge via the timeline animation)
- Implement collision checks/handles

== POSSIBLE FEATURES ==
- Make the playership a gunship wherein you play as a crew member manning the orb turret (would need to forfeit player controls for this)
- could switch "stations" for different weapons
